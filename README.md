# What is it
This is a simple (and tiny) text based menu system for
arduino projects.

You instantiate the menu class and then run it with a table
indicating which C functions should be called when a
'menu item character' is entered.

# Why
I built this so that I could put isolated pieces of code
in the menu handlers and then debug with the scope or volt meter
or other debug tools.

Its an easy way to slow things down, without having to use
a debugger - and you can also have other, less code-oriented
operators use it for test & validation.

# Installation
To install, copy copy the "andys_menu" into your Arduino libraries
directory.

# Use
Include in your project as per the example code in example/example.ino.

# Contact
Drop me a note on twitter - @andyidsinga - if you find it useful or
need help.
